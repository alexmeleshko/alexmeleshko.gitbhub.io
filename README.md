# **ABOUT ME**
#### Hi, I'm **Alex Meleshko**.  As an engineer, I provide unique and compelling research on investments in technology and the energy transition/renewables. I grew up in Western Canada, but fled the ice-capped Rocky Mountains for the warm, sunny Carolina coast where I reside with my wife and pitbull. To provide a sense of contrast, while I will write about my adventures in business and entrepreneurship, I am passionate about sharing raw insights on modern-day philosophy of sex, love, life and death.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
