# ABOUT ME
#### Hi, I'm **Alex Meleshko**.  As an engineer, I provide unique and compelling research on investments in technology and the energy transition/renewables. I grew up in Western Canada, but fled the ice-capped Rocky Mountains for the warm, sunny Carolina coast where I reside with my wife and pitbull. To provide a sense of contrast, while I will write about my adventures in business and entrepreneurship, I am passionate about sharing raw insights on modern-day philosophy of sex, love, life and death. 


Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.  
   
   Some text that should be aligned with the above item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
